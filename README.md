To Do:
Include visual callout for the logged-in user's plot
Fix CSS for produce page
Fix styling for forum and make it more responsive

Known Bugs:
Editing produce in any garden except Centennial does not work
User must refresh page to view updates when removing produce from a plot
Users can edit most plots when they should only be able to edit their own
SVG gaps should still register as "hovered" or "clicked"
